# lil-butcher

`Lil butcher` is a bot I made a night I was having a conversation with friend, with the mere purpose of having fun with them.

Butcher has two modes: _click spam_ and _message spam_ (also called _keyboard spam_)

- Click spam: is in charge of opening the sticker menu on whatsapp automatically and spamming the first most used sticker. Click spam asks for the desired amount of times you want to click before it stops.

- Keyboard spam: asks for an input message and the desired amount of times this message will be sent, and then spams it the introduced amount of times.

For stopping the spam, `enter` is to be pressed.
